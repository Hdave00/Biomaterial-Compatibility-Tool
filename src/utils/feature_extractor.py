"""
Yet another script that I made but didnt end up using, due to limited computing power as im using my CPU to train the models. The whole point of this feature
extractor was to make use of it as a helper in a ML script for a unified dataset comprised of multiple data files but the complex architecture requirements 
needed, in order to not overfit the model, on training the relationships between the features of each CSV, proved to be too much. 

In the future, with better hardware this is entirely plausible to develop & and the end result of a model that has learned the relationships between key
datapoints from each csv mentioned below, would be an amazing generalization for Regression tasks and even complex relationship plotting tasks, to predict
what material, with what type of micro-structures is suitably non-toxic for which bio-environment.
