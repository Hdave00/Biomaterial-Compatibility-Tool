# Biomaterial-Selection-and-Bioinformatics-Tool

## NOTE-- This README is incomplete as of now, basic operational instructions only, complete details coming very soon!

A modern Streamlit-based biomaterials intelligence platform combining:

* **Local database search** (details coming soon...)
* **Materials Project API integration** (real-time crystal structure, elasticity, magnetism, bonding, oxidation, and thermodynamic data) details coming soon
* **3D structure visualization** using **py3Dmol**
    - Visualisation not yet implemented for 3D Structures of elements/materials, more details coming soon...
* **Machine-learning pipelines** for structure prediction (details coming ...)

This project is part of a larger effort to build an intelligent decision-support system for materials science and biomaterials engineering.

## Datasets and citation

The datasets for this project can be found mainly at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I have used different datasets for different purposes, mainly the two domains of Machine Learning and a Search/Lookup functionality of data representation and visualisation.

1. [Young's Modulus of Metals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/youngs-modulus-of-metals) dataset for gathering and training the ML model to perform a regression task on predicting the potential young's modulus of metals given the following input parameters:
  - Density (g/cm³)
  - Hardness (BHN)
  - Tensile Strength (MPa)
  - Yield Strength (MPa)
  - Elongation (%)
  - Poisson’s Ratio
  - Hardness (HV)
  - Shear Modulus (GPa)

2. [RCSB_PDB Human Macromolecular Structure Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samiraalipour/rcsb-pdb-macromolecular-structure-dataset/data) for a protein structure database, used in the Oligomeric State Prediction task. This is a multi-task supervised learning model that performs classification and regression simultaneously to predict the oligomeric state (monomer, dimer, trimer, etc.) for a protein, given the following features of a protein:
  - Number of Chains: The number of distinct chains in the protein structure.
  - Helix Count: The number of alpha helices in the protein structure.
  - Coil Count: The number of coil (random coil) regions in the protein structure.
  - Molecular Weight per Deposited Model: The molecular weight of the entire protein structure, including all chains.
  - Stoichiometry: The ratio of components in the protein assembly.

## Machine Learning Architecture, libraries and methodology of predictions.

Explanation of why I chose the architecture, prediction methodology and the reasoning behind each machine learning pipeline.

### Main in use machine learning pipelines under src/ml_pipelines:

#### QSAR Pipeline for Ionic-Liquid Cytotoxicity

This module implements a fully automated **Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)** pipeline for predicting the cytotoxicity of ionic liquids using multiple curated CSV datasets. It supports both **regression (CC50 prediction)** and **binary toxicity classification**, and produces all required molecular fingerprints, physicochemical descriptors, metadata encodings, and trained machine-learning artifacts.

---

**1 Architectural Overview**



---

## **Features**

### 🔍 **Local Database Search**

* Query materials stored in your local CSV or database.
* Fast and cached lookup.
* Returns full material metadata.

---

### 🌐 **Materials Project Integration**

* Live lookup of:

  * Structure summaries
  * Elasticity data (when available)
  * Magnetism
  * Bonding information
  * Oxidation states
  * Surface properties
  * Thermodynamics (when available)
* Handles missing MP data gracefully.

---

### 🧪 **3D Structure Viewer** (not yet implemented...)

* Interactive **py3Dmol** molecular visualizer. (details coming soon...)
* Supports rotation, zoom, and style changes.
* Automatically loads valid MP structures.

---

### 🧮 **ML Prediction Pipelines**

* Details coming soon ...

---

### 🖥️ **Modern Streamlit Dashboard**

* Clean UI with custom CSS.
* Uses `st.session_state` for stable navigation.
* Mobile-aware responsive design.

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Hdave00/Biomat-test>
cd project
```

### **2. Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
MP_API_KEY=your_materials_project_api_key_here
```

This key is loaded in `mp_integration.py` using **python-dotenv**.

---

## **Running the App**

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

## **Usage Overview**

### **Local Search**

1. Navigate to **Local Search** tab.
2. Type a material name or ID.
3. Results appear instantly by caching.

### **Materials Project Lookup**

1. Select an element → structure → MP Entry ID.
2. View:

   * Material summary
   * Bonding + magnetism
   * Elasticity (when available)


---
### **ML Prediction**

1. Navigate to **Prediction** tab. (more details coming soon...)

---

## **Future Roadmap (Coming Soon...)**

* ML-enhanced materials recommendation engine
* Implant-specific constraints (shear force, cytotoxicity, budget, lifespan)
* Automated structure report PDF generator
* WASM-powered C modules for simulation
* User profiles & saved searches

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **No elasticity data**

Some MP entries simply do not contain elasticity measurements.
The UI will show:

> *“No elasticity data available for this entry.”*

### **Sub-types not appearing**

This happens if MP returns **no structures** for your element.
Try selecting another element or refresh the tab.
